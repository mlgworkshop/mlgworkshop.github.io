                            There is a great deal of interest in analyzing data that is best represented as a graph.
                            Examples include the WWW, social networks, biological networks, communication networks,
                            transportation networks, energy grids, and many others. These graphs are typically
                            multi-modal, multi-relational and dynamic. In the era of big data, the importance of being
                            able to effectively mine and learn from such data is growing, as more and more structured
                            and semi-structured data is becoming available. The workshop serves as a forum for
                            researchers from a variety of fields working on mining and learning from graphs to share and
                            discuss their latest findings.
                            <br />
                            There are many challenges involved in effectively mining and learning from this kind of
                            data, including:

                            Traditionally, a number of subareas have contributed to this space: communities in graph

                            programming, and, moving beyond subdisciplines in computer science, social network analysis,
                            and, more broadly network science.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Graphs are extensively used to model real-world complex systems. An
                        edge in a graph can model pairwise relationships. However, multiway relationships (connections
                        between three or more vertices) are common in many complex systems such as cellular process,
                        image segmentation, and circuit design. A graph edge cannot model multiway relationships. A
                        hypergraph, which can connect more than two vertices, is thus a better option to model multiway
                        relationships. A large-scale hypergraph analysis has the potential to find useful insights from
                        a complex system and assist in knowledge discovery. Currently a limited number of hypergraphs
                        exists that are representative of real-world datasets. Moreover, real-world hypergraph datasets
                        are small in size and inadequate to incorporate future needs. A graph generator that can produce
                        large-scale synthetic hypergraphs can solve the above mentioned problems. In this paper, we
                        present a scalable parallel hypergraph generator (HyGen) based on the Message Passing Interface
                        (MPI) standard. To generate hypergraphs, HyGen takes the following parameter values as inputs:
                        i) number of vertices, ii) number of hyperedges, iii) number of clusters, iv) vertex
                        distribution, v) hyperedge distribution, vi) local cluster cardinality, and vii) global cluster
                        cardinality. We have demonstrated that HyGen can generate hypergraphs of various sizes in a
                        scalable fashion. HyGen takes approximately four minutes to generate a hypergraph with 4.8
                        million vertices, 1.6 million hyperedges, and 800 clusters using 1,024 processes on a leadership
                        class computing platform. Our strong and weak scaling experiments on supercomputers demonstrate
                        that HyGen can quickly create large-scale hypergraphs in a parallel manner, thus providing a
                        useful capability for hypergraph analysis.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the problem of actively learning the vertex labels of a
                        graph, assuming the classes form geodesically convex subgraphs, which is related to linear
                        separability in the Euclidean setting. The main result of this paper is a novel query-efficient
                        active learning algorithm with label-independent upper bounds on the number of queries needed to
                        learn all labels. For that, we use shortest path covers and provide a logarithmic approximation
                        for the subproblem of computing a shortest path cover of minimum size. We extend the approach to
                        arbitrarily labeled graphs using a convexity-based selection criterion. Finally, we discuss
                        whether the convexity assumption holds on real-world data and give some first preliminary
                        results on citation and image benchmark datasets.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Data collected at very frequent intervals is usually extremely sparse
                        and has no structure that is exploitable by modern tensor decomposition algorithms. Thus the
                        utility of such tensors is low, in terms of the amount of interpretable and exploitable
                        structure that one can extract from them. In this paper, we introduce the problem of finding a
                        tensor of adaptive aggregated granularity that can be decomposed to reveal meaningful latent
                        concepts (structures) from datasets that, in their original form, are not amenable to tensor
                        analysis. Such datasets fall under the broad category of sparse point processes that evolve over
                        space and/or time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores adaptive
                        granularity aggregation in tensors. Furthermore, we formally define the problem and discuss what
                        different definitions of “good structure” can be in practice, and show that optimal solution is
                        of prohibitive combinatorial complexity. Subsequently, we propose an efficient and effective
                        greedy algorithm which follows a number of intuitive decision criteria that locally maximize the
                        “goodness of structure”, resulting in high-quality tensors. We evaluate our method on synthetic
                        and semi-synthetic data where ground truth is known. Our proposed method constructs tensors that
                        have very high structure quality.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Knowledge Graphs (KG) are gaining increasing attention in both
                        academia and industry. Despite their diverse benefits, recent research have identified social
                        and cultural biases embedded in the representations learned from KGs.
                        Such biases can have detrimental consequences on different population and minority groups as
                        applications of KG begin to intersect and interact with social spheres.
                        This paper describes our work-in-progress, which aims at identifying and mitigating such biases
                        in Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings.
                        As a first step, we explore popularity bias --- the relationship between node popularity and
                        link prediction accuracy.
                        In case of node2vec graph embeddings, we find that prediction accuracy of the embedding is
                        negatively correlated with the degree of the node.
                        However, in case of knowledge-graph embeddings (KGE), we observe an opposite trend.
                        As a second step, we explore gender bias in KGE, and a careful examination of popular KGE
                        algorithms suggest that sensitive attribute like the gender of a person can be predicted from
                        the embedding.
                        This implies that such biases in popular KGs is captured by the structural properties of the
                        embedding.
                        As a preliminary solution to debiasing KGs, we introduce a novel framework to filter out the
                        sensitive attribute information from the KG embeddings, which we call FAN (Filtering Adversarial
                        Network).
                        We also suggest the applicability of FAN for debiasing other network embeddings which could be
                        explored in future work.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Graph generation is a task that has been explored with a wide variety
                        of methods. Recently, several papers have applied Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to this
                        task, but most of these methods result in graphs of full or unknown rank. Many real-world graphs
                        have low rank, which roughly translates to the number of communities in that graph. Furthermore,
                        it has been shown that taking the low rank approximation of a graph can defend against
                        adversarial attacks. This suggests that testing models against graphs of different rank may be
                        useful.

                        However, current methods provide no way to control the rank of generated graphs. In this paper,
                        we propose BRGAN: a GAN architecture that generates synthetic graphs, which in addition to
                        having realistic graph features, also have bounded (low) rank. We extensively evaluate BRGAN and
                        show that it is able to generate synthetic graphs competitive with state-of-the-art models, with
                        rank equal to or lower than the desired rank.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Network alignment, the process of finding correspondences between
                        nodes in different graphs, has many scientific and industrial applications. Existing
                        unsupervised network alignment methods find suboptimal alignments that break up node
                        neighborhoods, i.e. do not preserve matched neighborhood consistency. To improve this, we
                        propose CONE-Align, which models intra-network proximity with node embeddings and matches nodes
                        across networks by comparing the embeddings after aligning their subspaces. Experiments on
                        diverse, challenging datasets show that CONE-Align is robust and obtains up to 49% greater
                        accuracy than the state-of-the-art graph alignment algorithms.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The development of new nanomaterials for energy technologies is
                        dependent on understanding the intricate relation between material properties and atomic
                        structure. It is, therefore, crucial to be able to routinely characterise the atomic structure
                        in nanomaterials, and a promising method for this task is Pair Distribution Function (PDF)
                        analysis. The PDF can be obtained through Fourier transformation of x-ray total scattering data,
                        and represents a histogram of all interatomic distances in the sample. Going from the distance
                        information in the PDF to a chemical structure is an unassigned distance geometry problem
                        (uDGP), and solving this is often the bottleneck in nanostructure analysis. In this work, we
                        propose to use a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to automatically solve the uDGP to
                        obtain valid chemical structures from PDFs. We use a simple model system of hypothetical
                        mono-metallic nanoparticles containing up to 100 atoms in the face centered cubic (FCC)
                        structure as a proof of concept. The model is trained to predict the assigned distance matrix
                        (aDM) from a simulated PDF of the structure as the conditional input. We introduce a novel
                        representation of structures by projecting them inside a unit sphere and adding additional
                        anchor points or satellites to help in the reconstruction of the chemical structure. The
                        performance of the CVAE model is compared to a Deterministic Autoencoder (DAE) showing that both
                        models are able to solve the uDGP reasonably well. We further show that the CVAE learns a
                        structured and meaningful latent embedding space which can be used to predict new chemical
                        structures.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Identifying biological entities such as genes and proteins from
                        scientific documents is crucial for further downstream tasks such as question answering and
                        information retrieval. This task is challenging because the same surface text can refer either
                        to a gene or a protein based on the context. Traditional approaches such as Huang et al.
                        consider the words present in the surrounding text to infer the context. However, they fail to
                        consider the semantics of these words which are better represented by contextual word embeddings
                        such as BERT. Deep learning based approaches, on the other hand, fail to make use of the
                        relational structure of scientific documents. We introduce a novel probabilistic approach that
                        jointly classifies all entity references using a class of undirected graphical models called
                        hinge-loss Markov random fields. Our approach can combine relational information with
                        embedding-based word semantics. Further, our approach can be easily extended to incorporate new
                        sources of information. Our initial evaluation on the JNLPBA shared task corpus shows that our
                        joint classification approach outperforms both traditional machine learning approaches and
                        semantic models based on word embeddings by up to 7.5% on F1 score.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Generation models of graphs have been used to compare and analyze the
                        properties of graph structures and to produce graphs that resemble real-world networks. When
                        using a generation model to mimic a real-world network, it is desirable for the error in the
                        properties between the target graph and the generated graph and the variation of the errors
                        between generated graphs are small. However, since many existing generation models generate
                        graphs by adding edges at random, the extent of the error and its variation for each generated
                        graph is unclear.
                        This paper studies the error and the variation of properties of graphs generated using the
                        dK-series framework, which has been proposed to analyze the topology of a network based on the
                        degree of nodes. In addition, we propose a new graph generation model that takes the degree
                        distribution and degree-dependent clustering coefficient as inputs. We show that the proposed
                        model is able to reduce the error to a greater extent than other generation models.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Node classification in networks is a common graph mining task. In
                        this paper, we examine how separating identity(a node’s attribute)and preference(the kind of
                        identities to which a node prefers to link)is useful for node classification in social networks.
                        Building upon recent work by Chin et al., where the separation of identity and preference is
                        accomplished through a technique called “decoupled smoothing”, we show how models that
                        characterize both identity and preference are able to capture the underlying structure in a
                        network, which leads to performance improvement in node classification tasks. Specifically, we
                        use probabilistic soft logic (PSL), a flexible and declarative statistical reasoning framework,
                        to model identity and preference. We compare our method with the original decoupled smoothing
                        method and other node classification methods implemented in PSL, and show that our approach
                        outperforms the state-of-the-art decoupled smoothing method as well as the other node
                        classification methods across all evaluation metrics on a real-world Facebook Dataset.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Relational classification exploits structural information in network
                        data to improve predictive performance. However, the large size of real-world networks causes
                        two main scalability issues for relational classification. First, training supervised models on
                        large networks is computationally expensive. Second, label acquisition for large samples can be
                        costly and unrealistic. The goal of Active learning is to query informative labels and reduce
                        labeling cost. However, state-of-the-art active learning strategies require multiple iterations
                        of learning, in order to pick the best labels at each iteration, which incurs higher
                        computational cost. In this work, we focus on a constrained version of the problem, named
                        one-shot active learning where the active learner has to decide which nodes to sample in one
                        shot, rather than iteratively. We consider several simple and network-based sampling strategies
                        as potential solutions to this problem. In our experiments, we show a comprehensive evaluation
                        of eleven different sampling methods on four real world network datasets using four relational
                        classifiers (wvRN, ICA, SGC, GraphSage), offering the first comparison between collective
                        classification and neural network approaches for one-shot active learning. Moreover, we propose
                        a novel sampling method based on Weisfeiler-Lehman graph labeling algorithm which shows overall
                        best performance across all classifiers and datasets. We empirically show that some of the
                        computationally cheaper one-shot active learning approaches can achieve comparable Micro-F1
                        scores to existing active learning methods that require multiple iterations.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Over the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in
                        temporal graphs, pushed by a growing availability of temporally-annotated network data coming
                        from social, biological and financial networks.
                        Despite the importance of analyzing complex temporal networks, there is a huge gap between the
                        set of definitions, algorithms and tools available to study large static graphs and the ones
                        available for temporal graphs.
                        An important task in temporal graph analysis is mining dense structures, i.e., identifying
                        high-density subgraphs together with the span in which this high density is observed.
                        In this paper, we introduce the concept of (k, \Delta)-truss (span-truss) in temporal graphs, a
                        temporal generalization of the k-truss, in which k captures the information about the density
                        and \Delta captures the time span in which this density holds. We then propose novel and
                        efficient algorithms to identify maximal span-trusses, namely the ones not dominated by any
                        other span-truss neither in the order k nor in the interval \Delta, and evaluate them on a
                        number of public available datasets.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this work, we examine a novel forecasting approach for COVID-19
                        that uses Graph Neural Networks and mobility data. In contrast to existing time series
                        forecasting models, the proposed approach learns from a single large-scale spatio-temporal
                        graph, where nodes represent the region-level human mobility, spatial edges represent the human
                        mobility based inter-region connectivity, and temporal edges represent node features through
                        time. We evaluate initial experiments on the US county level COVID-19 dataset, and show that the
                        rich spatial and temporal information unified by the graph neural network allows the model to
                        learn complex dynamics and make more accurate forecasts compared to autoregressive statistical
                        learning and sequence deep learning approaches. We believe this novel source of information
                        combined with graph based deep learning approaches can be a powerful tool to understand the
                        spread and evolution of COVID-19. We encourage others to further develop a novel modeling
                        paradigm for infectious disease based on this high resolution mobility data.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Typical graph embeddings may not capture type-specific bipartite
                        graph features that arise in such areas as recommender systems, data visualization, and drug
                        discovery. Machine learning methods utilized in these applications would be better served with
                        specialized embedding techniques. We propose two embeddings for bipartite graphs that decompose
                        edges into sets of indirect relationships between node neighborhoods. When sampling higher-order
                        relationships, we reinforce similarities through algebraic distance on graphs. We also introduce
                        ensemble embeddings to combine both into a "best of both worlds" embedding. The proposed methods
                        are evaluated on link prediction and recommendation tasks and compared with other
                        state-of-the-art embeddings. Our embeddings are found to perform better on recommendation tasks
                        and equally competitive in link prediction. Although all considered embeddings are beneficial in
                        particular applications, we demonstrate that none of those considered is clearly superior (in
                        contrast to what is claimed in many papers). Therefore, we discuss the trade offs among them,
                        noting that the methods proposed here are robust for applications relying on same-typed
                        comparisons.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are widely used for Representation
                        Learning in Graphs, but there is no proper study highlighting on what tasks GATs perform better
                        than other models and why. In this appraisal paper, we aim to improve our understanding of GATs
                        on a variety of tasks, including link prediction, multi-class node classification, and pairwise
                        node classification on benchmark datasets. We also perform ablation studies on the various
                        hyperparameters of GATs and try to reason about the importance of each of these in node
                        classification and link prediction tasks. Our study offers insights into the effectiveness of
                        GATs as compared to other techniques, and we make our code public so as to facilitate future
                        exploration.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results
                        on many graph analysis tasks such as node classification and link prediction. However, important
                        unsupervised problems on graphs, such as graph clustering, have proved more resistant to
                        advances in GNNs. In this paper, we study unsupervised training of GNN pooling in terms of their
                        clustering capabilities.

                        We start by drawing a connection between graph clustering and graph pooling: intuitively, a good
                        graph clustering is what one would expect from a GNN pooling layer. Counterintuitively, we show
                        that this is not true for state-of-the-art pooling methods, such as MinCut pooling. To address
                        these deficiencies, we introduce Deep Modularity Networks (DMoN), an unsupervised pooling method
                        inspired by the modularity measure of clustering quality, and show how it tackles recovery of
                        the challenging clustering structure of real-world graphs. In order to clarify the regimes where
                        existing methods fail, we carefully design a set of experiments on synthetic data which show
                        that DMoN is able to jointly leverage the signal from the graph structure and node attributes.
                        Similarly, on real-world data, we show that DMoN produces high quality clusters which correlate
                        strongly with ground truth labels, achieving state-of-the-art results.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The COVID-19 pandemic markedly changed the way of life in the United
                        States (US). From early isolated regional outbreaks to ongoing country-wise spread, the
                        contagion exhibits different patterns at various timescales and locations. Thus, a close study
                        of the COVID-19 spread patterns can offer valuable insights on how counties were affected by the
                        virus. In the present work, a graph frequency analysis was conducted to investigate the spread
                        pattern of COVID-19 in the US. A geographical graph was constructed by computing the geodesic
                        distance between 3142 US counties. The numbers of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases per county were
                        collected and represented as graph signals, then mapped into the frequency domain via the graph
                        Fourier transform. The concept of graph frequency in Graph Signal Processing (GSP) enables the
                        decomposition of graph signals (i.e. daily confirmed cases) into modes with smooth or rapid
                        variations with respect to the underlying graph connectivity. Follow-up analysis revealed the
                        relationship between graph frequency components and the COVID-19 spread pattern within and
                        across counties. Specifically, our preliminary graph frequency analysis mined (and learned from)
                        confirmed case counts to unveil spatio-temporal contagion patterns of COVID-19 incidence for
                        each US county. Overall, results here support the promising prospect of using GSP tools for
                        epidemiology knowledge discovery on graphs.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The graph summarization problem is to define a compressed data
                        structure that can concisely describe the original graph. A standard class of techniques for
                        summarization involves grouping nodes into supernodes via aggregation or clustering such that
                        the lp-reconstruction error, i.e. the p-norm between the original adjacency matrix and the
                        adjacency matrix recovered from the compressed summary, is minimized. Our main result shows that
                        graph summarization can be reformulated as a trace maximization problem, the relaxed version of
                        which can be solved exactly by all the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix. We also prove a
                        lower bound on the optimal solution which uses k eigenvectors for a summary with k supernodes.
                        Our results motivate a simple spectral clustering algorithm that can yield excellent summaries.
                        Our experiments validate the quality of the resultant summaries.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Deep RL approaches build much of their success on the ability of the
                        deep neural network to generate useful internal representations. Nevertheless, they suffer from
                        a high sample-complexity and starting with a good input representation can have a significant
                        impact on the performance. In this paper, we exploit the fact that the underlying Markov
                        decision process (MDP) represents a graph, which enables us to incorporate the topological
                        information for effective state representation learning.

                        Motivated by the recent success of node representations for several graph analytical tasks we
                        specifically investigate the capability of node representation learning methods to effectively
                        encode the topology of the underlying MDP in Deep RL. To this end, we perform a comparative
                        analysis of several models chosen from different classes of representation learning algorithms
                        for policy learning in grid-world navigation tasks, which are representative of a large class of
                        RL problems. We find that all embedding methods outperform the commonly used matrix
                        representation of grid-world environments in all of the studied cases. Moreoever, graph
                        convolution based methods are outperformed by simpler random walk based methods and graph linear
                        autoencoders.

                        of neighbors who are already "infected." LTM is often used with the assumption that node
                        thresholds are globally unique or randomly distributed. In many cases, however, thresholds can
                        differ between individuals, and knowing individual-level thresholds can lead to better diffusion
                        predictions. In this work, we propose a causal inference approach for estimating node
                        thresholds. We develop a Structural Causal Model to show the identifiability of causal effects
                        in the Linear Threshold Model, and map the threshold estimation problem to heterogeneous
                        treatment effect estimation. Through experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets,
                        we show that individualized thresholds play an important part in reliable long-term diffusion
                        prediction.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Graph representation learning is gaining popularity in a wide range
                        of applications, such as social networks analysis, computational biology, and recommender
                        systems. However, different with positive results from many academic studies, applying graph
                        neural networks (GNNs) in a real-world application is still challenging due to non-stationary
                        environments. The underlying distribution of streaming data changes unexpectedly, resulting in
                        different graph structures (a.k.a., concept drift). Therefore, it is essential to devise a
                        robust graph learning technique so that the model does not overfit to the training graphs. In
                        this work, we present Hop Sampling, a straightforward regularization method that can effectively
                        prevent GNNs from overfishing. The hop sampling randomly selects the number of propagation steps
                        rather than fixing it, and by doing so, it encourages the model to learn meaningful node
                        representation for all intermediate propagation layers and to experience a variety of plausible
                        graphs that are not in the training set. Particularly, we describe the use case of our method in
                        recommender systems, a representative example of the real-world non-stationary case. We
                        evaluated hop sampling on a large-scale real-world LINE dataset and conducted an online A/B/n
                        test in LINE Coupon recommender systems of LINE Wallet Tab. Experimental results demonstrate
                        that the proposed scheme improves the prediction accuracy of GNNs. We observed hop sampling
                        provides 7.97% and 16.93% improvements for NDCG and MAP compared to non-regularized GNN models
                        in our online service. Furthermore, models using hop sampling alleviate the oversmoothing issue
                        in GNNs enabling a deeper model as well as more diversified representation.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Triads, i.e., variously interconnected triplets of nodes,
                        significantly affect the network structure. Closed triads, for instance, are the building blocks
                        of communities. Our study focuses on the analysis of triads in which the ego is connected to two
                        alters, with the alters not having to be connected; therefore, the triads that are studied need
                        not be closed. The analysis uses two approaches based on asymmetric relationships between pairs
                        of nodes. In the first approach, we work with three different node roles, in which the ego and
                        its alters can appear in triads. We get a total of eighteen different role-based triad patterns.
                        The second approach allows us to work with a total of four different types of ties and six
                        different alter-pair patterns. In experiments with four different types of real-world networks,
                        we show how the properties of these networks differ in terms of role-based triad patterns. In
                        some of these networks, we further show that the triad-based properties remain stable during
                        network growth. The main contribution of our paper is the use of asymmetric relations for the
                        definition of four types of dependency-based tie strengths between nodes and the analysis of
                        their influence on the occurrence of different triad-based patterns in networks.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Graphs encode important structural properties of complex systems.
                        Machine learning on graphs has therefore emerged as an important technique in research and
                        applications. We present Karate Club - a Python framework combining more than 30
                        state-of-the-art graph mining algorithms. These unsupervised techniques make it easy to identify
                        and represent common graph features. The primary goal of the package is to make community
                        detection, node and whole graph embedding available to a wide audience of machine learning
                        researchers and practitioners. Karate Club is designed with an emphasis on a consistent
                        application interface, scalability, ease of use, sensible out of the box model behaviour,
                        standardized dataset ingestion, and output generation. This paper discusses the design
                        principles behind the framework with practical examples. We show Karate Club's efficiency in
                        learning performance on a wide range of real world clustering problems and classification tasks

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> We present Geo2DR (Geometric to Distributed Representations), a GPU
                        ready Python library for unsupervised learning on graph-structured data using discrete
                        substructure patterns and neural language models. It contains efficient implementations of
                        popular graph decomposition algorithms and neural language models in PyTorch which can be
                        combined to learn representations of graphs using the distributive hypothesis. Furthermore,
                        Geo2DR comes with general data processing and loading methods to bring substantial speed-up in
                        the training of the neural language models. Through this we provide a modular set of tools and
                        building blocks to quickly construct methods capable of learning distributed representations of
                        graphs. This is useful for replication of existing methods, modification, and development of
                        completely new methods. This paper serves to present the Geo2DR library and perform a
                        comprehensive comparative analysis of existing methods re-implemented using Geo2DR across widely
                        used graph classification benchmarks. Geo2DR displays a high reproducibility of results of
                        published methods and interoperability with other libraries useful for distributive language
                        modelling, making it a useful addition to the graph representation learning toolkit.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Social interaction, such as eye contact, speaking and listening, are
                        ubiquitous in our life and carries important clues of human's social status and psychological
                        state. With evolving dynamics fundamentally different from people's social relationships, the
                        complex interactions among a group of people are another informative resource to analyze
                        patterns of humans' social behaviors and characteristics. Despite the great importance, previous
                        approaches on extracting patterns from such dynamic social interactions are still underdeveloped
                        and overly task-specific. We fill this gap by proposing a temporal network formulation of the
                        problem, combined with a novel representation learning framework, temporal network-diffusion
                        convolution networks (TNDCN) that accommodates the many downstream tasks with a unified
                        structure: we creatively propagate people's fast-changing descriptive traits among their
                        evolving gazing networks with specially designed (1) network diffusion scheme and (2)
                        hierarchical pooling to learn high-quality embeddings for downstream tasks using a consistent
                        structure and minimal feature engineering. Analysis show that (1) can not only capture patterns
                        from existed interactions but also people's avoidance of interactions that turn out just as
                        critical. (2) allows us to flexibly collect different fine-grained critical interaction features
                        scattered over an extremely long time span, which is also key to success but essentially fails
                        all the previous temporal GNNs based on recurrent structures. We evaluate our model over three
                        different prediction tasks, detecting deception, dominance and nervousness. Our model not only
                        consistently outperforms previous baselines but also provides good interpretation by implying
                        two important pieces of social insight derived from the learned coefficients.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Effective link predictions in online social networks can help to
                        improve user experience and engagement, which are often associated with better health outcomes
                        for users of online health communities (OHCs). However, limited attention has been paid to
                        predicting social network links in OHCs. This paper explores link predictions in an OHC for
                        smoking cessation by considering it as a multi-relational social network that incorporates
                        multiple types of social relationships. We demonstrate that leveraging information from multiple
                        networks built based on different types of relationships is superior to using only information
                        from a single network or the aggregated network. In addition, adding community structures and
                        nodal similarities based on network embedding can help link predictions in different ways. Our
                        work has implications for the design and management of a successful online health community.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Sampling graphs is an important task in data mining. In this paper,
                        we describe Little Ball of Fur a Python library that includes more than twenty graph sampling
                        algorithms. Our goal is to make node, edge, and exploration-based network sampling techniques
                        accessible to a large number of professionals, researchers, and students in a single streamlined
                        framework. We created this framework with a focus on a coherent application public interface
                        which has a convenient design, generic input data requirements, and reasonable baseline settings
                        of algorithms. Here we overview these design foundations of the framework in detail with
                        illustrative code snippets. We show the practical usability of the library by estimating various
                        global statistics of social networks and web graphs. Experiments demonstrate that Little Ball of
                        Fur can speed up node and whole graph embedding techniques considerably with mildly
                        deteriorating the predictive value of distilled features.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Given a stream of graph edges from a dynamic graph, how can we assign
                        anomaly scores to edges in an online manner, for the purpose of detecting unusual behavior,
                        using constant time and memory? Existing approaches aim to detect individually surprising edges.
                        In this work, we propose MIDAS, which focuses on detecting microcluster anomalies, or suddenly
                        arriving groups of suspiciously similar edges, such as lockstep behavior, including denial of
                        service attacks in network traffic data. MIDAS has the following properties: (a) it detects
                        microcluster anomalies while providing theoretical guarantees about its false positive
                        probability; (b) it is online, thus processing each edge in constant time and constant memory,
                        and also processes the data 162-644 times faster than state-of-the-art approaches; (c) it
                        provides 42%-48% higher accuracy (in terms of AUC) than state-of-the-art approaches. Category:

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Work that will be presented at the main conference. Frequent pattern
                        mining is a key area of study that gives insights into the structure and dynamics of evolving
                        networks, such as social or road networks.
                        However, not only does a network evolve, but often the way that it evolves, itself evolves.
                        Thus, knowing, in addition to patterns' frequencies, for how long and how regularly they have
                        occurred—i.e., their persistence—can add to our understanding of evolving networks. In this
                        work, we propose the problem of mining activity that persists through time in continually
                        evolving networks—i.e., activity that repeatedly and consistently occurs. We extend the notion
                        of temporal motifs to capture activity among specific nodes, in what we call activity snippets,
                        which are small sequences of edge-updates that reoccur. We propose axioms and properties that a
                        measure of persistence should satisfy, and develop such a persistence measure. We also propose
                        PENminer, an efficient framework for mining activity snippets' Persistence in Evolving Networks,
                        and
                        design both offline and streaming algorithms. We apply PENminer to numerous real, large-scale
                        evolving networks and edge streams, and find activity that is surprisingly regular over a long
                        period of time, but too infrequent to be discovered by aggregate count alone, and bursts of
                        activity exposed by their lack of persistence. Our findings with PENminer include neighborhoods
                        in NYC where taxi traffic persisted through Hurricane Sandy, the opening of new bike-stations,
                        characteristics of social network users, and more. Moreover, we use PENminer to identify subtle
                        anomalies in a bike network and catch attacks in an IP-network, outperforming baselines by 8% in
                        AUC.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Network embedding has been an active research area given its
                        effectiveness in mapping nodes to low-dimensional representations.
                        While previous studies mostly focus on network topology, recent
                        advances have shown that rich node-level information, known as
                        attributes, often exist and can substantially benefit embedding based
                        on the assumption of homophily: nodes often connect to other nodes
                        similar to themselves. However, we find that inconsistencies often
                        occur in node attributes in real-world data, which can undermine the
                        homophily assumption and thus degrade the performance of attributed network embedding. To
                        address this drawback, in this paper,
                        we present a novel framework for unsupervised network embedding
                        with attribute refinement. In particular, we propose a learnable filter
                        to automatically refine the individual attributes of every node. To
                        overcome the challenge of no supervision, we leverage homophily to
                        guide the refinement—attributes should be fine-tuned in a way to reinforce the correlation with
                        topology. Finally, we conduct extensive
                        experiments on three benchmark real-world datasets, which show
                        that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
                        on both node classification and link prediction tasks. Furthermore,
                        we perform model analysis to demonstrate that our framework can
                        effectively refine attributes.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Network experiment design refers to the design of controlled
                        experiments for interacting units with the goal of estimating a causal effect of interest.
                        Estimating the effect of treatment alone on units' outcome, known as direct treatment effect, in
                        network experiments is challenging due to information spillover between peers through shared
                        edges. Prominent methods for network experiment design mostly focus on estimating total
                        treatment effects, the combination of peer effects and direct treatment effects. Less focus has
                        been given to approaches that provide an unbiased estimation of direct treatment effect.
                        We present a framework that takes advantage of independent sets and assigns treatment and
                        control only to a set of non-adjacent nodes in a graph, in order to disentangle peer effects
                        from direct treatment effect estimation. Randomizing over independent set nodes removes peer
                        effects between nodes in the experiment while canceling out the peer effects from nodes outside
                        the experiment.
                        Through a series of simulated experiments on synthetic and real-world network datasets, we show
                        that our framework significantly increases the accuracy of direct treatment effect estimation in
                        network experiments.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> We investigate the representation power of static node embeddings in
                        dynamic or temporal settings. To this end, we introduce a framework that incorporates different
                        design options for extending static node embeddings to temporal settings: temporal combination
                        schemes to introduce dynamics in otherwise static approaches, alignment methods that lead to
                        comparability of embedding dimensions across time steps, and different edge operators for
                        generating edge embeddings from node embeddings. In our empirical analysis, we evaluate the
                        performance of both proximity-based and structural node embedding methods in a temporal link
                        prediction task over four time-evolving networks. Our results show that proper choice over these
                        designs yields up to 20% absolute improvement over baselines that do not leverage temporal
                        combination and embedding alignment. We further present broad trends to guide design decisions
                        for embedding methods in temporal settings.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Category: Novel research paper. Whereas in traditional partitional
                        clustering, each data point belongs to a cluster, there are several applications where only some
                        of the points form relatively homogenous or "dense" groups, and points that don't seem to belong
                        to any cluster need to be ignored. Moreover, different clusters may emerge at different scales
                        or density levels. This makes it difficult to identify them using a single density threshold,
                        especially if we also want to ignore the non-clustering data. If data is represented in a metric
                        space, then recent extensions of a classical approach called Hierarchical Mode Analysis (HMA)
                        are able to identify clusters at multiple resolutions, while ignoring "non-dense" areas.
                        However, this approach does not apply when the relations between pairs of data points can only
                        be represented as a (sparse) similarity or affinity graph. Motivated by two complex, real-life
                        applications where one needs to identify dense subgraphs at multiple resolutions, while ignoring
                        nodes that are not well connected in the similarity graph, we introduce a novel algorithm called
                        HIMAG (Hierarchical Incremental Mode Analysis for Graphs) that provides capabilities analogous
                        to HMA based methods but applicable to graphs. We also provide a powerful multi-resolution
                        visualization tool customized for the new algorithm. We present results on the two motivating
                        real-world applications as well as two standard benchmark social graph datasets, to show the
                        power of our approach and compare it with some standard graph partitioning algorithms that were
                        retrofitted to produce dense clusters by pruning non-dense data in a non-trivial manner. We are
                        also open-sourcing the new dense graph datasets and tools to the community.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised graph representation
                        approach in a graph stream called SNAPSKETCH that can be used for anomaly detection. It first
                        performs a fixed-length random walk from each node in a network and constructs n-shingles from a
                        walk path. The top discriminative n-shingles identified using a frequency measure are projected
                        into a dimensional projection vector chosen uniformly at random. Finally, a graph is sketched
                        into a low-dimensional sketch vector using a simplified hashing of the projection vector and the
                        cost of shingles. Using the learned sketch vector, anomaly detection is done using the
                        state-of-the-art anomaly detection approach called RRCF [1]. SNAPSKETCH has several advantages,
                        including fully unsupervised learning, constant memory space usage, entire-graph embedding, and
                        real-time anomaly detection.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> In many application settings involving networks, such as messages
                        between users of an on-line social network or transactions between traders in financial markets,
                        the observed data consist of timestamped relational events, which form a continuous-time
                        network. We propose the Community Hawkes Independent Pairs (CHIP) generative model for such
                        networks. We show that applying spectral clustering to adjacency matrices constructed from
                        relational events generated by the CHIP model provides consistent community detection for a
                        growing number of nodes. We also develop consistent and computationally efficient estimators for
                        the model parameters. We demonstrate that our proposed CHIP model and estimation procedure
                        scales to large networks with tens of thousands of nodes and provides superior fits than
                        existing continuous-time network models on several real networks.
                        This submission is a novel research paper.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Semi-supervised node classification on graphs is a complex interplay
                        between graph structure, node features and class-assortative (homophily) properties, and the
                        flexibility of a model to capture these nuances. Modern datasets used to push the frontier for
                        these tasks exhibit diverse properties across these fronts, making it challenging to study how
                        these properties individually and jointly influence performance of modern embedding-based
                        methods like graph neural networks (GNNs) for this task. In this work-in-progress, we propose an
                        intuitive and flexible scale-free graph generation model, CaBaM, which enables simulation of
                        class-assortative and attributed graphs via the well-known Barabasi-Albert model. We show
                        empirically and theoretically how our model can easily describe a variety of graph types, while
                        imbuing the generated graphs with the necessary ingredients for attribute, topology, and
                        label-aware semi-supervised node-classification.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Identifying substitutable pairs or groups of products is key to
                        building relevant product assortment for brick-and-mortar stores as well as to efficiently
                        handle out of stock scenarios. In this work, we describe the unique challenges with a retailer’s
                        data to identify substitutable product pairs from a large catalog and nationwide store
                        transactions. We apply some of the well established approaches in data mining and machine
                        learning to customer store purchase data and product attributes data to generate networks of
                        substitutable products. This paper presents a novel application of substitutable product
                        networks integrated with an assortment optimization engine that was developed in-house to select
                        the optimal assortment of products for the stores. The outcomes from a large scale experiment
                        conducted across 120 stores within United States demonstrates a unit sale lift in excess of 11%.
                        In another set of tests, we analyze the performance of various algorithms for product
                        substitution and fulfillment when customers encounter Out of Stock (OOS) scenario while shopping

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Since its inception, Facebook has become an integral part of the
                        online social community. People rely on Facebook to connect with others and build communities.
                        As a result, it is paramount to protect the integrity of such a large network in a fast and
                        scalable manner. In this paper, we present our efforts to protect various social media entities
                        at Facebook from people who try to abuse our platform. We present a novel Temporal Interaction
                        EmbeddingS (TIES) model that is designed to capture rogue social interactions and flag them for
                        further suitable actions. TIES is a supervised, deep learning, production ready model at
                        Facebook-scale networks. Prior works on integrity problems are mostly focused on capturing
                        either only static or certain dynamic features of social entities. In contrast, TIES can capture
                        both these variant behaviors in a unified model owing to the recent strides made in the domains
                        of graph embedding and deep sequential pattern learning. To show the real-world impact of TIES,
                        we present a few applications especially for preventing spread of misinformation, fake account
                        detection, and reducing ads payment risks in order to enhance Facebook platform’s integrity.

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> While most network embedding techniques model the proximity between
                        nodes in a network, recently there has been significant interest in structural embeddings that
                        are based on node equivalences, a notion rooted in sociology: equivalences or positions are
                        collections of nodes that have similar roles—i.e., similar functions, ties or interactions with
                        nodes in other positions—irrespective of their distance or reachability in the network. Unlike
                        the proximity-based methods that are rigorously evaluated in the literature, the evaluation of
                        structural embeddings is less mature. or real networks with labels that are arbitrarily defined,
                        and its connection to sociological equivalences has hitherto been vague and tenuous. To fill in
                        this gap, we set out to understand what types of equivalences structural embeddings capture. We
                        are the first to contribute rigorous intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methodology for
                        structural embeddings, along with carefully-designed, diverse datasets of varying sizes. We
                        observe a number of different evaluation variables that can lead to different results (e.g.,
                        choice of similarity measure or label definitions). We find that degree distributions within
                        nodes’ local neighborhoods can lead to simple yet effective baselines. We hope that our findings
                        can influence the design of further node embedding methods and also pave the way for future
                        evaluation of existing methods. **Category: appraisal paper**

                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Graph representation learning based on graph neural networks (GNNs)
                        can greatly improve the performance of downstream tasks, such as node and graph classification.
                        However, the general GNN models do not aggregate node information in a hierarchical manner, and
                        can miss key higher-order structural features of many graphs. The hierarchical aggregation also
                        enables the graph representations to be explainable. In addition, supervised graph
                        representation learning requires labeled data, which is expensive and error-prone. To address
                        these issues, we present an unsupervised graph representation learning method, Unsupervised
                        Hierarchical Graph Representation (UHGR), which can generate hierarchical representations of
                        graphs. Our method focuses on maximizing mutual information between "local" and high-level
                        "global" representations, which enables us to learn the node embeddings and graph embeddings
                        without any labeled data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform
                        the node and graph classification using the learned node and graph embeddings. The results show
                        that the proposed method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art supervised methods on
                        several benchmarks. In addition, our visualization of hierarchical representations indicates
                        that our method can capture meaningful and interpretable clusters.

                            This workshop is a forum for exchanging ideas and methods for mining and learning with
                            graphs, developing new common understandings of the problems at hand, sharing of data sets
                            where applicable, and leveraging existing knowledge from different disciplines. The goal is
                            to bring together researchers from academia, industry, and government, to create a forum for
                            discussing recent advances in graph analysis. In doing so, we aim to better understand the
                            overarching principles and the limitations of our current methods and to inspire research on
                            new algorithms and techniques for mining and learning with graphs.

                            To reflect the broad scope of work on mining and learning with graphs, we encourage
                            submissions that span the spectrum from theoretical analysis to algorithms and
                            implementation, to applications and empirical studies. As an example, the growth of
                            user-generated content on blogs, microblogs, discussion forums, product reviews, etc., has
                            given rise to a host of new opportunities for graph mining in the analysis of social media.
                            We encourage submissions on theory, methods, and applications focusing on a broad range of
                            graph-based approaches in various domains.
